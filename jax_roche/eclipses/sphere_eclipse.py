def sphere_eclipse_any(cosi, sini, position, centre, rsphere):
    """
    Does a sphere eclipse a point at any phase?

    If the answer is yes, it will also return with four parameters
    to define the phase range and the multiplier range delimiting the
    region within which the spheres surface is crossed. These can be used
    for later computation.

    The multiplier must be positive: in other words the routine does not
    project backwards. If the point in inside the sphere, phi1=0.0 and
    phi2=1.0, lam1 = 0, and lam2 = the largest value of the multiplier lambda.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cosi: float
        The cosine of the inclination angle
    sini: float
        The sine of the inclination angle
    position: `jax_roche.Vec3`
        The position vector of the point in the binary.
    centre: `jax_roche.Vec3`
        The centre of the sphere
    rsphere: float
        The radius of the sphere

    Returns
    -------
    eclipsed: bool
        True if the point is eclipsed, False if not
    phi1: float
        The phase giving the first cut point.
        This is the start of the phase range (0-1) where the point is
        eclipsed. If the point is inside the sphere, phi1=0.0
    phi2: float
        The phase giving the second cut point.
        This is the end of the phase range (0-1) where the point is
        eclipsed. If the point is inside the sphere, phi2=1.0
    lam1: float
        The multiplier giving the first cut point (>=0). A point in the
        binary system is defined as the position vector plus the multiplier
        times the line of sight vector towards Earth.

        If the point is inside the sphere, lam1=0.0
    lam2: float
        The multiplier giving the second cut point (>lam1). A point in the
        binary system is defined as the position vector plus the multiplier
        times the line of sight vector towards Earth.

        If the point is inside the sphere, lam2 is the largest value of
        the multiplier lambda.

    Does a sphere eclipse a point at a given phase?
