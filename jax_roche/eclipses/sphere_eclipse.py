def sphere_eclipse(earth, position, centre, rsphere):
    """
    Does a sphere eclipse a point or not?

    This will also return the multiplier values giving the cut points.
    These can then be used as starting points for Roche lobe computations.

    Points inside the sphere are regarded as being eclipsed with the lower multiplier set = 0.

    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineâ€“sphere_intersection for method

    Parameters
    ----------
    earth: `jax_roche.Vec3`
        A unit vectory pointing towards the Observer (Earth).
    position: `jax_roche.Vec3`
        The position vector of the point in the binary.
    centre: `jax_roche.Vec3`
        The centre of the sphere
    rsphere: float
        The radius of the sphere

    Returns
    -------
    eclipsed: bool
        True if the point is eclipsed, False if not
    lam1: float
        The multiplier giving the first cut point
    lam2: float
        The multiplier giving the second cut point
