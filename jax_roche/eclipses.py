    """
    This routine finds if a point in a semi-detached binary is occulted by the donor star.
    It works by first eliminating as many cases as possible that are far from being
    occulted, before applying a brute force method of stepping along the line-of-sight
    to that position and checking if it ever falls within the Roche Lobe.

    To speed things up, `blink` can accept a cache of stored values which need to
    be re-computed every time q changes. If the cache is not provided, these
    values are computed from scratch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q: float, `jnp.DeviceArray`
        Mass ratio M2/M1
    position: `jax_roche.Vec3`
        The position vector of the point in the binary, scaled by binary separation
    earth: `jax_roche.Vec3`
        A unit vectory pointing towards the Observer (Earth).
        Usually, this is (sini(i)*cos(phi), -sin(i)*sin(phi), cos(i)),
        where phi is the orbital phase and i is the inclination.
    acc: float, `jnp.DeviceArray` (default=0.1)
        Step size parameter.
        acc specifies the size of steps taken when trying to see if the photon path
        goes inside the Roche lobe. The step size is roughly acc times the radius
        of the lobe filling star. This means that the photon path could mistakenly
        not be occulted if it passed less than about (acc**2)/8 of the radius below
        the surface of the Roche lobe. acc of order 0.1 should therefore do the job.
    cache_precision: int
        Number of decimal places to use as key cache. Values of q that agree to within
        this number of decimal places will use cached values for quantities like the
        critical potential instead of recalculating them.
    cache: tuple
        Stored values of quantities like the critical potential

    eclipsed: bool
        True if the point is eclipsed, False if not
